# Arctic's Dotfiles

Hello, this repository keeps a copy of my dotfiles in it.

Although you can (theoretically) poke around in here to look at these configs,
there are usually no comments, and these files are generally just for me.
_Please_ do not ask questions about my dotfiles, as they're crufty, not
really designed for human consumption or for anyone else to use but myself,
and are rarely updated even if I've started using a different kind of config or
stopped using a program referred to by this config.

Thanks!
